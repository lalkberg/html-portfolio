<h1>The Best Films of all Time in Leo's Opinion</h1>
<h2>My top 4 films</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Little Women</h3>
<p>Beautiful pocket of history through the eyes of four sisters during the American Civil War. Heartbreaking and warming at the same time.</p>

<h3>Back to the Future</h3>
<p>Insanely entertaining sci-fi comedy about a kid from the 80's who's traveled back to the 1950's, desperately trying to get home while making sure his parents fall in love.</p>

<h3>Paris, Texas</h3>
<p>The most beautiful movie ever put to film. Follows a vagrant who turns up in the middle of the desert after being missing for four years, and his quest to reunite with his family.</p>

<h3>Blade Runner</h3>
<p>The greatest film ever made, according to it's director and I can't help but agree. In the futuristic year of 2019, a hardened former detective is tasked with "retiring" four rogue replicants, humanoid robots who are trying to escape captivity and seek eternal life at any cost.</p>
